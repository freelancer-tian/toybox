# Toybox Theme


A WooCommerce‑ready block theme. Edit layouts in **Appearance → Editor**. Customize colors/spacing in **theme.json**. Use the included block patterns (Hero, USP Row, Home Product Grid) to build the homepage quickly.


### Tips
- Set your store currency to **ZAR** in WooCommerce → Settings → General.
- Use **Products → Attributes** for age range, material, brand, etc. These appear on single‑product pages and for layered filtering.
- Use **Product Categories** for navigation menus and the Shop page sidebar filters.
- Bulk‑upload with CSV via **Products → All Products → Import**.


### Optional: Child Theme
If you plan to update the parent frequently, create a child theme. Otherwise, this starter is safe to treat as your custom theme.
